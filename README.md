- Hello, I’m @ruetheday - Keevin Yazzie
- I’m interested in music, reading, and studying. I have started learning more about coding so that is a new interest as well.
- I’m currently learning about computer science through CS50x and CS50p which are free classes from Harvard university.
- I am currently majoring in Public Health but I have always been interested in Computer Science so I am currently thinking about switching majors.
- The main way to reach me is through my personal email which is: keevinyazzie3@gmail.com
